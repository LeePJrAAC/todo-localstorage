        Buzz words. Simply put they are not who I am. Yes, they describe my work in 10 words or less, but again, they
        are not who I am. I am a simple person. I like simple things in my life. I am a self-described audiophile with a
        limited budget. I play computer games. I love my pets, four cats and a dog. And I love the woman in my life.

        And none of that helps you, or maybe it does. Let us speak candidly. One of the parts of me not mentioned in the
        above is that I am also a Quadriplegic. Without a medical explanation, let us keep it short to the following. I
        have limited mobility in my hands and cannot feel anything from mid-chest down. Mentioning this puts me at a
        disadvantage or so I have been told. But there is another part of me not mentioned above, I am honest to a
        fault. My biggest pet peeve is lying. Do not lie to me. Do not lie to clients in front of me. While I will hold
        my tongue, you have now lost all my respect and trust. And while respect is freely given, trust is earned. Lying
        has never brought about a positive outcome.

        If youâ€™ve read this far, that means there is something about me that intrigues you. So let us now talk about me
        as a professional. I graduated Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida in January of 2020 in Simulations
        and Visualizations, a BS degree in virtual reality also known as immersive technologies. Then in January of 2021
        I was hired by Potawatomi Training, LLC (PT) as a Media Developer, placed into a Frontend Developer role where I
        learned HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery on the job. At PT I collaborated with a team building two different
        e-learning websites for US government entities. The first website has a focus on language. The second website is
        on military provisioning. As the second project was entering its final stages I found a position at Advanced
        Automation Corporation (AAC) where I am currently employed. Here at AAC I am once again working on an e-learning
        course for a government entity. This time though, the course is built in ReactJS, again learned on the job.

        As a Developer I love getting a new task where I get to build new user experiences. For instance, two of my most
        favorite pages within the current project are a page representing Flash Cards and a Media Player. In Flash Cards
        we present the learner with options to customize the content to help ease their learning of the material. The
        media player is written with performance and appearance in mind. Keeping the design simple, yet familiar while
        adding other features such as Focus Points and Knowledge Checks. Focus Points are timestamps chosen for content
        that should be noted by the learner. Knowledge Checks are like Focus Points in that they rely on timestamps;
        they differ in that they ask the learner a question regarding the content being presented.
